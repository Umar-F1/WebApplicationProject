                <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <h2>Home made cupcakes brought to you by Aisha Desai.
                        Having attended culinary school and advanced baking courses, I saw a niche in the local market.
                        I've always enjoyed baking and making cupcakes in particular
                        and due to popular deman I decided to open up my own home business
                        2 years ago to cater my cupcakes to the people of Stanger.
                        <br>
                        In that time I have managed to build a strong relationship with
                        my customers. Alot of whom are friends, families, colleagues and neighbours.
                        It's always been a privilege to bring great tasting desserts to a close-knit community.
                        <br>
                        Being a small town, means to make a product for the people around me, people
                        I may see everyday when going to the market. Therefore I aim to continue providing
                        a service that satisfies and satiates the tastebuds of those in my community. 
                        I believe by not going mainstream, is when the best of my ability shines through.
